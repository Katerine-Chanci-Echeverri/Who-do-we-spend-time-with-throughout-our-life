# Who-do-we-spend-time-with-throughout-our-life
This was part of a data visualization exercise. 
This data set was taken from Makeover Monday. Who do we spend time with across our lifetimes?
Data Source: Our World in Data, was published on November 7th, 2022. The data comes from time-use surveys, where people are asked to list all the activities that they perform over a full day, and the people who were there during each activity.

When we’re young – particularly in our teens – we spend a lot of our time with friends, parents, siblings and extended family. As we enter our 20s, time with friends, siblings and parents starts to drop off quickly. Instead, we start spending an increasing amount of time with partners and children. This continues throughout our 30s, 40s and 50s – over this period of their life, Americans spend much of their time with partners, children and, unsurprisingly, co-workers. For those 60 and older, we see a significant drop-off in time spent with co-workers. Older people spend a large amount of time alone and it is understandable why – time spent alone increases with age because this is when health typically deteriorates and people lose relatives and friends.
